# CODEPEN STARTER TEMPLATE

I love Codepen, but prefer to develop in my own editor, with my own browser.

This is a little project to work locally with the same setup I use in Codepen:

#### CSS
- Normalize.css
- Autoprefixer
- PostCSS

#### JS
- Babel
- Lodash

Feel free to use it, modify it, whatever.

##Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start dev server with watch

```
gulp
```

Write html in `./index.html` between the comments.

Write css in `./src/style.css` below the comment.

Write js in `./src/main.css` below the comment.

When done, copy-paste in the Codepen editor, make sure to include the correct dependencies in Codepen.
